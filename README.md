# Mitochondrial One-Carbon Metabolism is Required for TGF-β-Induced Glycine Synthesis and Fibrotic Responses
PAPER LINK

# Summary
We have previously shown that TGF-β upregulates the expression of the enzymes of the de novo serine/glycine synthesis pathway in lung fibroblasts through mTORC1 and ATF4-dependent transcriptional programs.
In this study, we demonstrate that TGF-β induces the expression of MTHFD2, MTHFD1L, and ALDH1L2 in human lung fibroblasts. MTHFD2 expression was required for TGF-β-induced cellular glycine accumulation and collagen protein production.
